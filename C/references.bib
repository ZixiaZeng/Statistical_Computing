  abstract     = {This study compares various F1-score variants—micro, macro, and weighted—to assess their performance in evaluating text-based emotion classification. Lexicon distillation is employed using the multilabel emotion-annotated datasets XED and GoEmotions. The aim of this paper is to understand when each F1-score variant is better suited for evaluating text-based multilabel emotion classification.},
